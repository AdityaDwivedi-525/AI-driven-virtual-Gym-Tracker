AI-Driven Virtual Gym Tracker

AI-Driven Virtual Gym Tracker is a real-time computer vision-based fitness system that tracks human body posture using a webcam. The system uses MediaPipe pose estimation and OpenCV to detect body landmarks, analyze exercises, count repetitions, and detect correct poses. It helps users perform workouts accurately without the need for a physical trainer.

Project Overview

This project aims to build a smart and low-cost virtual fitness trainer that can monitor exercises such as squats, push-ups, and yoga poses in real time. It provides posture feedback and ensures correct body alignment during workouts. The system works using only a webcam and does not require any wearable devices

Features
